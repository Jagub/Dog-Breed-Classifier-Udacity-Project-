Our city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.We need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

For this image classification task, we will be using an image classification application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. we will use a CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet(opens in a new tab). There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on your criteria. With this project, we will explore the three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and determine which is best for our application.

We have with us classifier function in classifier.py that will allow you to use these CNNs to classify your images. The test_classifier.py file contains an example program that demonstrates how to use the classifier function.
